            <p>Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted chicken, fresh veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg.
                Inspired by traditional Japanese ramen, but on the table in under an hour.</p>
        
        <h2>You'll love this easy to make chicken ramen</h2>
            <p>Real japanese ramen, the kind that you might've heard stories about, take years and great skill to perfect.
                I wanted to create a simple ramen soup that reminded people of Japan, but could be made quickly, with ingredients on hand.

                I opted for chicken instead of pork, but kept the rest of the ramen style somewhat traditional: an amazing chicken base
                with garlic, ginger, shitake mushrooms and soy sauce, fitted with squiggly ramen noodles, succulent chicken and topped 
                with fresh spring onions and a soft-boiled egg.

                My version is on the table in less than an hour - and half that if you opt to use store-bought chicken - and while it might not be
                completely authentic; it's a flavorful, comforting soup just in time for the unmistakably chrisp, chilly autumn weather that these
                first days of December have ushered in.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Alright, now that you've got everything you need, let me show you how to make it!</p>

            <h3>Cooking the chicken</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375℉ and season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Melt the butter in a large overn-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin side down,
                    and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, or about 5-7 minutes.
                    Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
                    Remove from the oven, transfet the chicken to a plate and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Making the broth</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat your oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for 
                    a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute. </li>
                <li>Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes,
                    then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt to taste.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Making the soft-boiled eggs</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs
                    (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk)</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process.
                    Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise.
                    Set aside until ready to serve.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Assembling the ramen bowls</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. 
                    When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.</li>
                <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. 
                    Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!</li>
            </ol>
