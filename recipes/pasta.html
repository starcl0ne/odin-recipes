        <p>This creamy pasta bake is one of my favourite mid-week pasta dishes. My whole family loves it, and thers is not much prep to do!. Once the pasta bake is in the oven, you can make a salad or set the table, and then it's time to eat.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here's what you'll need!</p>

        </ul>


        <h2>Got everything? Great! Let's get cooking.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400F (200C) and grease a baking dish.</li>
            
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add Penne and cook, stirring occasionally until tender, about 11 minutes. 
                Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.</li>
            
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
                Add garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce and tomato paste and cook until slightly reduced,
                about 5 minutes. Add cream and parmesan cheese. Season with sugar, salt and pepper.</li>
            
            <li>Stir some of the reserved pasta water into sauce and add cooked penne. Remove from the heat and stir in cherry tomatoes,
                1/2 of the mozzarella and basil. Add more pasta water if needed to reach desired consistency. Pour penne mixture into the prepared
                baking dish and cover with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 20 minutes</li>
        </ol>
